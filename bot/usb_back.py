#Simple example on how to connect to and send commands to the sys module.
#The example is for Pokemon Sword/Shield, it reads a .ek8 file from a certain file path, injects it into box1slot1
#and starts a surprise trade with the given pokemon. It waits a certain amount of time (hoping the trade has completed)
#before retrieving the new pokemon. Finally it extracts the pokemons .ek8 data from the game and saves it to the hard drive.
#The script assumes the game is set up in a way that the character is not currently in any menus and that the cursor of the
#pokebox is on box1slot1.

#The script isn't exactly robust, there are many ways to make it better (for example one could compare the box1slot1 data in
#RAM with that of the pokemon sent to see if a trade has been found and if not back out of the menu to search for another 10 
#seconds or so instead of waiting a fixed 45 seconds), but it is rather meant as a showcase of the functionalites of the 
#sysmodule anyway.

#Commands:
#make sure to append \r\n to the end of the command string or the switch args parser might not work
#responses end with a \n (only poke has a response atm)

#click A/B/X/Y/LSTICK/RSTICK/L/R/ZL/ZR/PLUS/MINUS/DLEFT/DUP/DDOWN/DRIGHT/HOME/CAPTURE
#press A/B/X/Y/LSTICK/RSTICK/L/R/ZL/ZR/PLUS/MINUS/DLEFT/DUP/DDOWN/DRIGHT/HOME/CAPTURE
#release A/B/X/Y/LSTICK/RSTICK/L/R/ZL/ZR/PLUS/MINUS/DLEFT/DUP/DDOWN/DRIGHT/HOME/CAPTURE

#peek <address in hex, prefaced by 0x> <amount of bytes, dec or hex with 0x>
#poke <address in hex, prefaced by 0x> <data, if in hex prefaced with 0x>

#setStick LEFT/RIGHT <xVal from -0x8000 to 0x7FFF> <yVal from -0x8000 to 0x7FFF
#sys-botbase developed by olliz0r
#usb support added by fishguy6564
#This script is an adaptation of the example script originally distributed with the original sys-botbase
#Noteable differences are that a new function to read data was created to make it simpler for the end user called readData()
#sendCommand now only needs one string argument instead of the socket and string command.
#A buffer between reading data and executing the next command isn't needed as the usb interface handles that itself
#The necessary escape characters needed for the parser are handled by the sys-module instead of the script now
#Dependencies are listed on github
